# Climbing Twister
Climbing Twister is a play on the classic game of Twister, in which players contort their bodies by attempting to reach specific body parts to specific colors on a colored mat. Climbing is a passion of mine, so I chose to explore how Twister changes when played on a climbing wall, with climbing holds to grab, instead of colors on a mat, with a specific interest in the way that the premise of Twister encourages physical intimacy between players. 

The absence of intimacy in games highlights a broader cultural tendency to emphasize conflict as the driving theme in play. From the strategic battles of Chess to the virtual warfare of Call of Duty, most games rely on oppositional dynamics where players aim to outwit or overpower one another. These structures reinforce the idea that games are spaces for domination, rather than connection. In contrast, Twister introduces a unique form of competition that intertwines physical proximity and care. Unlike traditional games, it requires players to navigate their physical space together, often leading to surprisingly vulnerable moments. By forcing participants to touch each other's bodies—often in areas typically associated private contexts, like the chest and thighs—it challenges social norms around touch and intimacy in non-romantic settings.

Climbing Twister furthers this idea, as the larger space of play and variety of climbing holds introduce many new, awkward, intimate positions for players to experience with one another, with players frequently discovering that their bodies have become intertwined in ways they'd never considered before. In encouraging this, however, a variety of adaptations of the original ruleset were required. The space of play is the obvious first concern, as climbing walls tend to be very large, and have many holds, varied in both shape and color. As such, players select from a list of available holds and colors, rather than having a static color selection and space of play. Secondly, given how physically vast the space of play is, the coach is required to prioritize moving players towards one another, whenver possible. To facilitate this idea, the coach has complete agency over which limb players move. The game only selects from a color, a hold, and a general movement to get into the given position; which limb accomplishes that is left unspecified. 

Climbing Twister exists to further Twister's decades-old challenge of cultural perceptions around play and intimacy, creating an experience of play driven by physical care, rather than conflict.
